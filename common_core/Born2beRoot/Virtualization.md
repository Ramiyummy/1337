### What is virtualization?

Virtualization is computing technology that simulates physical hardware functionality to create software-based IT services like applications, servers, storage, and networks. By creating a virtual version of a resource or device (such as a desktop computer) from one computer system, virtualization enables companies to reduce hardware costs and increase efficiency.
### How does virtualization work?

A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs), which are software emulations of a computing hardware environment. Sometimes called a virtual machine monitor (VMM), the hypervisor isolates the operating system and computing resources from the virtual machines and enables the creation and management of those VMs. These virtual machines—simply, code operating in a server's memory space—enable administrators to have a dedicated machine for every service they need to run.
